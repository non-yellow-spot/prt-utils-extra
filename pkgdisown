# Which files are disowned by CRUX package manager?

  cat <<EOH
List files disowned by CRUX package management.

usage: `basename $0` [update]

The script does the following:

1. Get the packages files into /tmp/db.
2. Get all filesystem files into /tmp/fs.
   You can write directories that should not be involved in the process
   in the file '/etc/pkgdisown.conf'.

3. Compare the /tmp/db with /tmp/fs and show disowned files.

The optional argument 'update' performs steps 1 and 2.
Since these two steps take a long time, relative to the third step.
